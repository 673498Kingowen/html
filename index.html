            <p>LunarARCH is a modern distro for ARCH users on Linux OS.<br/> 
            We have made 3 different distros based on ARCH which are KDE Plasma, KDE macOS and i3wm.</p>

                    <h3>KDE Plasma</h3>
                    <p>Use KDE Plasma to surf the web; keep in touch with colleagues, friends and family; manage your files, enjoy music and videos; 
                    and get creative and productive at work. Do it all in a beautiful environment that adapts to your needs, 
                    and with the safety, privacy-protection and peace of mind that the best Free Open Source Software has to offer</p>

                    <h3>KDE macOS</h3>
                    <p>KDE macOS is just like the previous KDE Plasma with different customization. We have customized it to users that are more familiar with macOS.
                    We tried making it as similar to macOS, however it is still a linux based operativsystem. Otherwise the keyboard layout and other configuration are similar to macintosh</p>

                    <h3>i3wm</h3>
                    <p>i3wm is a dynamic tiling window manager inspired by wmii that is primarily targeted at developers and advanced users. The stated goals for i3 include clear documentation,
                    proper multi-monitor support, a tree structure for windows, and different modes like in vim.</p>
